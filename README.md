# Chromium Review Dataset

We create a Python script, chromium.py to extract the data from our raw dataset, which download from the review repository of Chromium Project (See http://sdlab.naist.jp/reviewmining/). In addition, this script creates a database schema and the data was stored in a MySQL database.
