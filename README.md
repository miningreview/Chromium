# Mining Chromium Review Dataset

We created a Python script, chromium.py to extract data from the raw dataset (See http://sdlab.naist.jp/reviewmining/). 
This script creates a database schema and stores the data in a MySQL database.

Before running the script, make sure you have a MySQL database installed.
